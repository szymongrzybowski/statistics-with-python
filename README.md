# statistics-with-python
The purpose of this repository is to provide a short and easy to understand tutorial on statistics. The guide contains definitions, formulas, examples, Python codes, and the applications of specific statistical methods.

The code consists of two parts: the first is functions written using Python itself without any additional libraries. In this case, the code is longer, but it allows to visualize the successive steps of the calculation.

The second part contains codes that use the Numpy library.

The codes for the first part are borrowed from the book "Data Science from Scratch" by Joel Grus.

Python version: 3.8.1
